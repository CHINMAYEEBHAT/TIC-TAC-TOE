# TIC-TAC-TOE
Project Title: Development of a 2-Player Tic Tac Toe Game using R Programming Language
Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to design and implement a two-player Tic Tac Toe game using the R programming language. Tic Tac Toe is a classic, strategic game that involves two players taking turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Expected Outcome:
The successful completion of this project will result in a fully functional 2-player Tic Tac Toe game written in the R programming language. The game should be easy to understand, engaging for players, and should run without errors or unexpected behavior.
